    "The most common representation of a network in a mathematical sense is an **adjacency matrix**. For a network with $n$ nodes, an adjacency matrix is an $n \\times n$ matrix, which we'll often denote $A$. If there is an edge between node $i$ and node $j$, then there is some nonzero element at the $i, j$-th element of $A$, $a_{ij}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an **unweighted network**, the convention is for the matrix to have a \"1\" anywhere there is an edge, and a \"0\" otherwise. One example of an unweighted network is a social network, where each node is a person. We could say that there is an edge between two people if they are friends on Facebook, and there is not an edge otherwise. You may \n",
    "also hear the term \"binary network\" used to mean unweighted, since the elements of the adjacency matrix are 0s and 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **weighted network**, $a_{ij}$ will have a nonzero value representing the weight associated with that edge. For an example of a weighted network, we could consider another social network formed from email communications. We could say that there is an edge between any two people who emailed each other during a given time period, but we could further say that the edge weight is the *number of emails* between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an **undirected network**, we are only interested in whether there is a relationship\n",
    "between node $i$ and node $j$. There is no distinction between an edge from $i$\n",
    "to $j$ vs an edge from $j$ to $i$. Thus, in the adjacency matrix, we have that \n",
    "$a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. This makes the matrix *symmetric*: $A = A^T$. In our social network \n",
    "analogy, an undirected network could come from a network of Facebook friends, where a \n",
    "friendship from person $i$ to $j$ necessarily implies that $j$ is friends with $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a **directed network**, we do not have the constraint above, and $a_{ij}$ does not \n",
    "necessarily equal $a_{ji}$. Continuing our social network analogy, Twitter could be\n",
    "modeled as a network of accounts, with directed edges from $i$ to $j$ if person $i$ \n",

    "[**Sparse matrices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) are a wonderful way to get around this problem when working with sparse networks. In Python, the most common sparse matrix format [can be found in `SciPy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html). A sparse matrix format typically saves memory (if the data is sparse) by only explicitly representing any non-zero entries, and then assuming that all other elements of the matrix are zero. The main disadvantage to using a sparse matrix is that they are often more difficult to manipulate and modify than a dense array, but sparse matrices can allow us to store or operate on adjacency matrices which would otherwise be too large to store in memory. There are many different kinds of sparse matrices (see both links earlier in this section), but for now, we'll just focus on the [**compressed sparse row (CSR)**](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html#scipy.sparse.csr_matrix) format.\n"
