# What are networks (and why should you care)?

---
# What are networks?
- Networks are a mathematical way of representing a set of objects and the relationships among them.
- These "objects" are termed **nodes** or **vertices**.
- These relationships are termed **edges** or, less often, **links**.
- Networks are also called **graphs**.

# What are NOT networks? - Hypergraphs
- Networks represent **dyadic** relationships: interactions between *two* things.
  - Example: an email from me to you  
- **Polyadic** relationships (interactions between more than two things) are common.
  - Example: an email from me to you AND someone else
- We could ignore this: 
  - Make an edge from me to you.
  - Make another, separate edge from me to someone else.
- **Hypergraphs** are a mathematical way of representing general polyadic relationships.

---
# What are NOT networks? - Multigraphs
- Graphs (strictly speaking) usually have at most one edge between node $i$ and node $j$.
- There may be multiple relationships between two nodes in data that we want to model.
  - Example: An email from me to you, and a phone call from me to you.
- Sometimes we can compress this information into at most one edge, and still use a graph.
  - Example: Create an edge if there was an email OR a phone call.
- **Multigraphs** allow for more than one edge from node $i$ to node $j$.
