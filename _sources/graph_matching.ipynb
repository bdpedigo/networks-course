    "Permutations, for us, will be represented by [**permutation matrices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_matrix).\n",
    "A permutation matrix is $n \\times n$, with all zeros except for $n$ 1s. More specifically, each row and column has exactly one 1 in it. Let's look at\n",

    "relaxes the constraint that $P$ be a permutation matrix. Via the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem, it can be shown that the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull)\n",
    "of the permutation matrices is the set of [**doubly stochastic matrices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_matrix). A doubly stochastic matrix just has row \n",

    "- While the number of edges in the two networks matters, the most important scaling factor is the number of nodes. Solving the graph matching problem using our code may take a while when you have more than a few thousand nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The current implementation only works for dense arrays. There is no reason we couldn't make it work for sparse (and we plan to) but because the most important factor in the scaling is the number of nodes, this wouldn't make a drastic difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As with many algorithms we've talked about in this course, the results will likely be different with different runs of the algorithm. This is primarily because of the initialization. The `n_init` parameter to `GraphMatch` allows you to do multiple initializations and take the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can play with the `max_iter` and `eps` parameters to control how hard the algorithm will try to keep improving its results. Scaling these can give you better performance (but will possibly take longer) or quicker results (but the accuracy may suffer).\n",
    "\n",
    "- I recommend always leaving the `shuffle_input` parameter set to `True` - for reasons I won't go into, the input order of the two networks will matter otherwise, and this can give inflated or misleading performance if you aren't careful."
