# Final project
## Notebook
- The final project is a short analysis of some dataset in the form of a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) which will be submitted and added to this repo in the form of a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
   - The steps to submit the pull request will be much like those of the [mini-assignment](mini_assignment.md). 
- The notebook should describe (using text and figures):
   - The dataset(s) you investigated, and what you wanted to learn. At a bare minimum:
     - What do the nodes represent?
     - What do the edges represent?
     - How many nodes and edges are there?
     - Is the network weighted? If so, what do the weights represent?
     - Is the network directed? If so, what does the edge direction come from?
     - If there are multiple networks, how is each one different?
   - The methods you used, explained at a level that someone else in the class would definitely understand
   - The results you found, with a few figures showing these results
   - A brief discussion of the meaning of these results
- You are welcome to collaborate, but 
   - Each student must submit their own notebook and write their own code. 
   - If there's something you want to collaborate more extensively on, discuss with instructor. 
   - Acknowledge any people you collaborated with in the notebook.
- Reference any articles, data sources, etc. you used in your notebook.
- **Notebooks are due Thursday, January 20th at 12pm (noon) ET.** This will give me time to address any issues with your pull requests and merge them by the time we have presentations the next day.
   - You are encouraged to submit pull requests earlier than this, and I am happy to provide feedback! 

## Presentation
- Everyone will present their final projects **on the last day of class, January 21st.**
- Presentations should be <5 minutes (no longer than 5) with 2 minutes for questions.
- Presentation should briefly cover the same main points from the notebook. 
   - Some details from the notebook you may not have time to cover in the presentation; that's OK.
