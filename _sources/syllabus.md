## Course description
Networks represent data by describing a set of objects and the relations between them. Networks are ubiquitous in many fields of science: for example, they have been used to represent social interactions, relationships between genes or protein sequences, and the connectivity of neurons in the brain. This project-based course will introduce students to the process of analyzing real-world network data in Python. Topics covered will include network representations, centrality and ranking measures, modularity and community detection, network embeddings, graph neural networks, random graph models, graph matching, and network hypothesis testing. This is a hands-on, project-based course - students will submit a brief analysis (in Python) of some real-world network dataset for their final project. Familiarity with Python, statistics, and linear algebra is very highly encouraged.

## Prerequisites
```{warning} The following prerequisites are highly recommended to take this course. In particular, Python experience will be important in order to be able to submit the final project. Please talk to the instructor if you are unsure about your prior knowledge for any of these:
```
- Python programming experience 
- Linear algebra 
- Probability/statistics

## Topics
For specific topics covered, please see the [calendar page](page:calendar).

## Materials
### Code/software
#### Primary
- [graspologic](https://graspologic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- [Scipy's sparse graph routines](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html)

#### Also mentioned 
- [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/)
- [scikit-network](https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/)

### Books
The following books may be useful material during the course, but none of them are
required to rent or buy:
- [Networks by Mark Newman](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/networks-9780198805090?cc=us&lang=en&)
- [Atlas for the Aspiring Network Scientist](https://www.networkatlas.eu/)
- [Hands-on Network Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Graspologic](http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/coverpage.html) (book not yet finished)

### Other resources
- [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://staging.distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/)

## Grading
To pass, a student must: 
- Attend and engage with every lecture (please let the instructor know if you need to miss a lecture for some reason)
- Submit the pre-project mini-assignment by 11:59pm on Jan 5th
- Submit any other mini-assignments (these may be very minor things like filling out surveys, telling me what your final project will be, etc.)
- Submit a merge-able final project notebook by 12pm (noon) on Jan 20th (Thursday)
- Present their final project on the last day of class, Jan 21st (Friday)

## Final project
See the [Final project tab](final_project.md)

## Office hours
After class or by appointment. I also expect most lecture days to have a significant 
group work proportion where you can ask questions.

## Python development
- I highly recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for 
Python development, as it has lots of nice features for working with GitHub and Jupyter 
Book. It will also make it easier for me to help you debug if using VS Code. 
- There is a
nice article on [*Getting Started with Python in VS Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial), which also includes instructions on getting a Python interpreter.
- Make sure you are always using some kind of virtual environment for developing in Python. This is described in the article above [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-and-use-packages).

```{note}
If you have a lot of experience using Python/developing some other way and you are 
welcome to stick with it, just note that it may be harder for me to provide feedback for
other IDEs or Python setups.
```

## Accommodations
My goal is for this course to be a safe and accessible place for anyone to learn. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to accomodate any needs towards that end.

## Feedback
I am always open to feedback (positive or negative) on this course. You can leave any 
comments you have [here](https://forms.gle/UxFB2sSQiQyrxr5AA). Can be totally anonymous,
if you'd like.

<!-- ## Sick policy
My #1 priority is making sure everyone has a safe environment to learn - to this end, and out of respect
for your peers and the instructor, PLEASE do not attend in person class if you are at all sick. 
Missing class for an illness will never be held against you, please just let me know what
is going on and we will come up with a plan.  -->
